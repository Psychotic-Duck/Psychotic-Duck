If it looks like a duck...
If it walks like a duck...
If it swims like a duck...
If it flies like a duck...
If it quacks like a duck...
If it fraudulently distributes contraband like a duck...
If it watches endlessly like a duck...
If it gazes at your delicious pets like a duck...
If it plans for the domination of the world like a duck...
If it tries to test your identity like a duck...
If it robs your attention from a debate like a duck...
If it sits as helplessly as a duck...
If it instills a false weakness and innocence like a duck...
If it ruins your code like a duck...
If it stifles the development of programming methodology like a duck...



Then it is most certainly a witch, and must be burned.
